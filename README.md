# Packer
### Description
A simple Python script for simplifying the workflow of packaging skinpacks for the Minecraft Marketplace.
### Features
- Generation of all necessary directories.
- Generation of manifest.json including UUID's.
- Generation of skins.json and en_US.lang given skin names.
### Notes
- Packer should be placed in whatever directory you store your skinpacks in. Packer will each skinpack's parent directory in the directory where the script is located.
- This tool is not finished at all, it was quickly made for the team I work for. I do plan to add more features and support to it incrementally.
